By default, the tests are run with the database driver sqlite3.  To change this,
simply edit the utils.py file and uncomment the right "from <db type>_config"
line (commenting out all others).  You will then need to edit the 
corresponding "<db type>_config" file to make sure that the connection string 
matches your test database.

Then, just rerun the test suite.
